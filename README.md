Variables are used to store and manage values, making it easier to work with data in your code. Variable names are case-sensitive and can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores, but they must start with a letter or an underscore.
  example:  variable_name = value
            variable_name is the name of the variable.
            value is the data you want to store in the variable.

A statement in Python is a complete line of code that performs an action or a task. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, and each statement is typically written on a single line. 
  example:  a = 5: Assigns the value 5 to the variable a.
            b = 7: Assigns the value 7 to the variable b.
            sum_result = a + b: Calculates the sum of a and b and assigns the result to the variable sum_result.
